# Getting Started with Tests in React

- Unit test

  - Test one unit of code in isolation

- Integration Tests
  - How multiple tests work together

### React testing library suggests functional test over unit tests as it defines behaviour more properly

- Functional tests

  - This kind of tests checks the behaviour of the app not the implementation
  - This are rigid and only fails when behaviour/functionality changes

- Acceptance tests/ End to end Tests
  - Use a actual browser using cypress or selenium

In tests regex `i` means case insensitive

On react testing library website you can find which queries are better to use than other queries
For Example - Like get getByRole is better than getByText

If you are not sure about roles you can always go to [W3C Roles Definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions) to check out possible roles.

---

Some important points

- In unit tests we only have one expect statement per test
- In Functional tests since we test the behavior of our application it's not reasonable to limit to just one expect statement per test

### More Jest Controls

- Use `p` to _select a specific test file_ for jest to run
- Use `test.only(...)` while writing test to run only that test from that file and skip other tests
- Use `test.skip(...)` while writing test to skip one test from that file and run other tests
- If you don't want jest to run all your test every time you do `npm test` or automatically in watch mode, you have to commit it.

---

### Css Module Imports

- `.toHaveStyle()` does not work with classes from imported CSS module. Jest simply ignores any imported css modules.
- CSS are not usually tested because they are cosmetic rather than functionality but not like in every application. Here the course [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/learn/lecture/30436464#content) for more details

---

### When to use Unit Test

- Logic is complicated enough to check via functional tests
- If there are too many edge cases
- Determining what caused functional tests to fail

---

### Describe statement

It is used to group tests together

---

Note: `Quit jest in terminal using q`

---

### Some eslint configuration for jest

Note: `Make sure your remove eslint config from package.json`

You have to use both the config to make the eslint for jest work

<details>
<summary>Eslint Config for .eslintrc.json file</summary>
<br>

Create the file on same level as gitignore file.

`Install these libraries first.`

```
npm i eslint-plugin-testing-library eslint-plugin-jest-dom
```

```
{
  "plugins": ["jest-dom", "testing-library"],
  "extends": ["react-app", "react-app/jest", "plugin:testing-library/react", "plugin:jest-dom/recommended"]
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Eslint Config for settings.json file</summary>
<br>

Create a folder with name .vscode on same level as gitignore file and settings.json file inside it.

```
{
  "eslint.options": {
    "overrideConfigFile": ".eslintrc.json"
  },
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

</details>

<br/>

To test the above configuration try replacing

```
expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
```

with :

```
expect(linkElement).not.toBeEnabled();
```

<details>
<summary>Udemy Course Author's config for the .eslintrc.json file</summary>
<br>

This one's optional to above eslintrc file.
`This settings might not work as some of things might not be supported now. But worth a try.`

### User-Events

It's recommended to use userEvents over fireEvents
`fireEvent` dispatches DOM events, whereas user-event simulates full interactions, which may fire multiple events and do additional checks along the way.

To use User-Events downloading following dependencies

```
npm i @testing-library/user-event@14.4.0 @testing-library/dom
```

### Different Methods For Screen Queries

- get: expect element to be in DOM
- query: expected element to not be in DOM
- find: expect element to appear async
- ALL

  - (exclude) expect only one match
  - (include) expect more than one match

- QueryType
  - Role (most preferred)
  - AltText (images)
  - Text
  - Form elements
    - Placeholder Texts
    - Label Texts
    - DisplayValue

### Mock Service Workers

Mock Service workers are used to mock the functioning of api calls for testing purposes.
Documentation Link [MSW](https://mswjs.io/docs/)

Install it `npm i msw`

There are two handlers type in msw REST or GRAPHQL

For Setup Documentation [MSW Setup](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/node)

For Setting up Mock Service worker add the following lines in `setupTests.js` file

```
// src/setupTests.js
import { server } from './mocks/server.js'
// Establish API mocking before all tests.
beforeAll(() => server.listen())

// Reset any request handlers that we may add during the tests,
// so they don't affect other tests.
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

// Clean up after the tests are finished.
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

Note-
Whenever you are waiting for something to appear asynchronously on the page you must use `await findBy`

### Alert and await problem - Soluton waitFor

await doesn't works for Alerts as their could be multiple alerts and each one will come at different time..

So instead use `waitFor`

WaitFor Example

```
    await waitFor(async () => {
        const alerts = await screen.findAllByRole('alert');
        expect(alerts).toHaveLength(2);
    });
```

### Debugging

- To print the DOM in the test console just use `screen.debug()`
- `getBy` fails when there a server call or other async action
  - use `await findBy` in this case

| Warning Can't perform react state update on a unmounted component. Indicates memory leak in your application | There was an update to component state after the test completed                     |

### Jest Mock Functions

Jest Mock functions are mock functions that don't actually do anything but they are there in case like when you are passing a function on a component.

For example -
`<SomeComponent onClick={jest.fn()}/>`

Here `jest.fn()` doesn't actually do anything it's just a filler.
